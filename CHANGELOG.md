## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Major Pivot: The SuperAI Era
Shifted focus from "Enterprise Wrapper" to "Best-in-Class AI Coding Harness" (SuperAI).

### Changed
- **Branding:** Renamed "JULES" to "SuperAI Engine" or "SuperAI Command".
- **Documentation:** Massive reorganization of `SUBMODULES.md` into functional categories (Memory, CLI, Agents).
- **Core:** Fully migrated from Fastify routes to Hono for better performance and type safety.
- **Structure:** Reorganized submodules into functional zones (`memory/`, `superai-cli/`) for better discoverability.

### Removed
- **Legacy Routes:** Deleted `contextRoutes.ts`, `ingestionRoutes.ts`, `memoryRoutes.ts` (Fastify versions).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Configured Vitest at monorepo root with unified test runner.
  - New test suites for `CouncilManager` and `SessionManager` in `packages/core/test/`.

### Removed
- **Submodules:** Removed redundant `submodules/opencode-autopilot-backup`.

### Documentation
- **Architecture Analysis:** Documented SessionManager separation (Core vs Autopilot serve different purposes).
- **UI Drift:** Identified orchestration logic drift between UI port and Autopilot Council (sequential vs parallel debate).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-08
