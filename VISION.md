# Vision

## North star

Borg is the **local-first control plane** for MCP tooling, provider routing, session continuity, and operator observability.

It is building toward a future where one local system can coordinate the most important parts of AI-heavy work: tools, models, sessions, context, and visibility.

That future only becomes credible if the present system is reliable.

## The problem

AI workflows are fragmenting faster than they are becoming usable. A serious operator may now rely on:
- multiple MCP servers,
- multiple provider accounts and quotas,
- multiple coding or session harnesses,
- multiple memory surfaces,
- and weak observability across all of them.

Borg exists to reduce that fragmentation with a practical local substrate.

## Core thesis

The strongest version of Borg is not the loudest one. It is the version that makes a messy local AI stack feel:
- calm,
- visible,
- composable,
- and recoverable.

## Practical product direction

### 1. MCP coordination
Borg should become the clearest place to:
- register MCP servers,
- inspect tools,
- manage working sets,
- understand runtime state,
- and diagnose failure.

Over time, Borg should also maintain a **definitive internal MCP server library**:
- ingest MCP servers from public lists and operator-added sources,
- normalize and deduplicate overlapping entries,
- preserve provenance and operator trust,
- keep that library refreshed internally,
- benchmark and rank implementations over time,
- and make it possible for models to eventually reach any relevant MCP tool through one local control plane.

That library should grow into more than a registry dump. The ambitious version is an operator-owned intelligence layer for the MCP ecosystem: what exists, what overlaps, what is trustworthy, what performs well, what is broken, and which tool is best for a given task.

### 2. Model and provider routing
Borg should make provider behavior legible:
- fallback chains,
- quota exhaustion,
- auth-state changes,
- budget-sensitive routing,
- and routing history.

### 3. Session continuity and memory
Borg should help one operator continue work without rebuilding context from scratch:
- better session recovery,
- useful memory retrieval,
- stronger provenance,
- and clearer context inspection.

### 4. Operator observability
Borg should make it easy to answer:
- what is running,
- what is failing,
- what changed,
- which provider or tool is misbehaving,
- and whether a page is showing real state or partial state.

### 5. Universal tool reach
Borg should eventually behave like an operator-owned substrate for model capability:
- any model,
- any provider,
- any approved MCP server,
- any relevant tool,
- with routing, provenance, policy, and supervision handled in one place.

### 6. Harness convergence
Borg should absorb important local coding harnesses through explicit, inspectable integration instead of hand-wavy compatibility claims. Today that includes tracking upstreams like `submodules/borg`, assigning them first-class harness identity in Borg CLI flows, and only expanding runtime coupling when the upstream actually exposes stable behavior to integrate.

## What Borg is not optimizing for in v1

- mass-market simplicity
- hosted SaaS-first workflows
- speculative autonomy as a substitute for operator control
- broad “AI OS” claims without proof
- platform expansion that outruns reliability

## Long-term direction

If Borg succeeds over time, it could support richer orchestration layers, stronger automation, and more advanced coordination across tools. That includes a curated, continuously updated internal catalog of MCP servers, a living understanding of tool quality and provenance, and a universal model-facing control plane that makes broad tool reach practical without turning operators into full-time integrators.

That is a **long-term direction**, not a current release promise.

## Maturity model

Every major capability should be described as:
- **Stable**
- **Beta**
- **Experimental**
- **Vision**

This language should appear consistently in docs and UI.

## Non-goals for v1

The following may remain outside a focused `v1.0.0`:
- marketplace ecosystems
- universal ingestion of every public MCP server list
- economy or payment systems
- mesh networking
- immersive visualizations
- major rewrites before stabilization

## Design principles

1. **Local first**
2. **Truth over hype**
3. **Visible systems**
4. **Interoperability over reinvention**
5. **Continuity over novelty**

## Best current promise

> Borg aims to be a dependable local AI control plane first, and a richer orchestration environment second.

That sequencing is the whole game.

## North star

HyperCode is the **ultimate local-first control plane** for multi-agent workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP) tooling, provider routing, session continuity, and operator observability.

It is building toward a future where one local system seamlessly coordinates the most critical parts of AI-driven software development: tools, models, sessions, context, subagents, and full visibility across the entire stack.

That future only becomes credible if the present system is reliable, truthful, and meticulously engineered for extreme robustness.

## The problem

AI workflows are fragmenting faster than they are becoming usable. A serious operator may now rely on:
- Multiple, disparate MCP servers with overlapping tools.
- Multiple AI provider accounts, quotas, API keys, and fallback chains.
- Multiple coding or session harnesses (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Claude Code).
- Multiple memory surfaces (RAG, vector DBs, file-based contexts).
- Weak observability, logging, and crash-recovery across all of the above.

HyperCode exists to eradicate that fragmentation by providing a unified, practical, and highly capable local substrate.

## Core thesis

The strongest version of HyperCode is not a chaotic wrapper, but a **decision system and universal bridge**. It is the version that makes a messy local AI stack feel:
- **Calm**: Automatic orchestration, recovery, and fallback models.
- **Visible**: Comprehensive dashboards with real-time status, traffic inspection, and memory insight.
- **Composable**: Dynamic tool grouping, code execution sandboxes, and progressive tool disclosure.
- **Recoverable**: Persistent session history, crash isolation, and auto-restarting daemons.

## Practical product direction

### 1. The Ultimate MCP Control Plane
HyperCode must become the absolute authority for:
- Registering, instantiating, and managing the lifecycle of MCP servers.
- Inspecting traffic, enforcing timeout rules, and providing single-instance pooling for multiple clients.
- Normalizing, grouping, and semantically searching tools (Tool RAG).
- Enabling code-mode execution for complex tool chains and deferred binary loading.
- Managing environment variables, secrets, and auth across all servers.

**The Definitive Library**: Over time, HyperCode must maintain a definitive internal library of MCP servers aggregated from public catalogs, deduplicating overlapping entries, tracking provenance, and benchmarking tool implementations. Models will be able to reach any relevant tool in the ecosystem through one unified, local router.

### 2. Universal Tool Reach & First-Class Parity
Large Language Models are fine-tuned on the exact tool signatures used by the most popular coding environments. HyperCode's mandate is **Absolute 1:1 Parity**. If a model expects `bash`, `glob`, `file_read`, or `grep_search` (from Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI), HyperCode provides a tool that is byte-for-byte identical in schema and behavior.

### 3. Model and Provider Routing
HyperCode makes provider behavior legible and automated:
- Configurable fallback chains across models and APIs.
- Intelligent routing based on quota exhaustion, free tiers, and budget limits.
- Clear dashboards for auth-state, historical cost, and routing rules.

### 4. Session Continuity and Omniscient Memory
HyperCode ensures an operator can continue work without rebuilding context from scratch:
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects, imports, and parses sessions from *all* AI harnesses (IDEs, CLIs, Web) into durable memories.
- **Memory Subsystems**: A pluggable memory ecosystem (file-based, vector DB, RAG) with automatic context harvesting, chunking, reranking, and semantic search.
- **Web Integrations**: Browser extensions that inject MCP tools into web chats and export histories into the universal memory bank.

### 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration & Council Debate
HyperCode provides an ecosystem for autonomous subagents and team-based modeling:
- Orchestrating a session where multiple frontier models (e.g., GPT, Gemini, Claude) take turns implementing, testing, and planning in a shared chatroom.
- Debate protocols, consensus voting, and autoDev loops under the supervision of a dedicated council.

### 6. Architectural Convergence (The Daemon Family)
HyperCode is transitioning toward a robust, small family of focused binaries rather than a monolithic IPC bottleneck. The long-term topology includes:
- `hypercoded` — the primary control-plane daemon.
- `hypermcpd` — the MCP router, aggregator, and pool manager.
- `hypermemd` — the long-running memory and context daemon.
- `hyperingest` — the background worker for batch imports (like BobbyBookmarks) and deduplication.
- `hyperharnessd` — the execution loop and isolation boundary.
- GUI Clients: CLI (`hypercode`), Web UI (`hypercode-web`), Desktop (`hypercode-native`).

## What HyperCode is not optimizing for in v1

- Mass-market simplicity at the cost of operator control.
- Hosted SaaS-first workflows (we are explicitly local-first).
- Speculative platform expansion that outruns core reliability and truthfulness.

## Design principles

1. **Local first, but Cloud Aware**: Total local sovereignty with seamless remote deployment and syncing.
2. **Truth over hype**: Dashboards must reflect actual database rows and runtime state, not mocked UI scaffolds.
3. **Visible systems**: Everything—from LLM reasoning to MCP network traffic—must be inspectable.
4. **Interoperability over reinvention**: Wrap, adapt, and assimilate existing excellent tools (like ripgrep, SQLite, LanceDB) instead of rewriting them poorly.
5. **Continuity over novelty**: Focus heavily on state recovery, crash resilience, and session persistence.
