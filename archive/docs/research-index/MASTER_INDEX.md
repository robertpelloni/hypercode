## Notes

### Deduplication Strategy
- Cross-reference URLs to identify duplicates
- Merge information from multiple sources about same project
- Track forks and original repositories

### Integration Approach
1. Add as submodule for reference
2. Research thoroughly (docs, source, issues, PRs)
3. Categorize and document features
4. Assess relevance to Borg goals
5. Decide: Wrap | Call Directly | Reimplement | Reference Only
6. Document decision and reasoning

### Feature Parity Tracking
For each CLI harness, track parity status:
- OpenCode: ⏸️
- Claude Code: ⏸️
- Codebuff: ⏸️
- Codex: ⏸️
- Copilot CLI: ⏸️
- Crush: ⏸️
- Factory: ⏸️
- Gemini CLI: ⏸️
- Goose CLI: ⏸️
- Grok Build: ⏸️
- Kilo Code: ⏸️
- Kimi CLI: ⏸️
- Mistral Vibe: ⏸️
- Qwen Code: ⏸️
- Warp: ⏸️
- Trae: ⏸️

### MCP Architecture Notes

Borg should serve as both:
1. **Ultimate MCP Client**: Aggregating, routing, traffic inspection, progressive disclosure
2. **Ultimate MCP Server**: Universal configuration, session management, tool grouping

**UPDATE (2026-01-17)**: Ultimate MCP Router implementation is COMPLETE with 4 core services created in `packages/core/src/services/`:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| MCPRegistryService | Discover servers from external registries |
| ServerRegistryService | Install/update servers from GitHub/npm |
| ConfigurationService | Auto-detect configs, expand env/secrets |
| McpSessionService | Auto-start, auto-restart, keep-alive, latency tracking |

See `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for full details and integration guide.

Key features to implement:
- Single instance with multiple client support ✅
- Latency monitoring and health checks ✅
- Auto-start, auto-restart ✅
- Tool namespace/group management ✅
- Dynamic loading/unloading
- Traffic inspection and logging ✅
- TOON format support ✅
- Code mode implementation
