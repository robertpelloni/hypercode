# Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Purpose**: SDKs, frameworks, and systems for coordinating multiple AI agents

## Overview

Multi-agent orchestration systems enable teams of AI agents to collaborate, debate, and coordinate on complex tasks. This category tracks frameworks, SDKs, and reference implementations for Borg's autonomous agent council and supervisor functionality.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Add as submodules** for reference
2. **Study orchestration patterns** (consensus, debate, supervision)
3. **Extract useful concepts** (A2A protocol, tool chaining, etc.)
4. **Implement agent council** with multi-model debate
5. **Build supervisor system** for autonomous task delegation
6. **Create agent spawning** and lifecycle management

## Borg Agent Architecture

Borg should implement:
- **Agent Council**: Multiple models debating high-stakes decisions
- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates subagents for complex tasks
- **Autopilot**: Autonomous multi-step task execution
- **Handoff Protocol**: Seamless handoff between agents
- **Fallback System**: Automatic model switching on failure
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Voting for critical decisions
- **Subagent Registry**: Library of specialized subagents
- **Multi-Model Pair Programming**: Multiple models collaborating
