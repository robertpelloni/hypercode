# Routers / Providers

**Purpose**: API gateways, model routing, provider management systems

## Overview

Router and provider systems manage API access, load balancing, and intelligent model selection across multiple AI providers. This category tracks aggregators, gateways, and provider management tools for Borg's routing capabilities.

## Borg Router Architecture

Borg should implement:
- **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, etc.
- **Intelligent routing**: Select model based on task, cost, quality
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across providers
- **Fallback system**: Auto-switch on quota/errors
- **Quota tracking**: Monitor credits and usage
- **Cost optimization**: Choose cheapest model for task
- **Model ranking**: Sort by quality/speed/cost
- **Provider groups**: Group by provider (all Gemini 3 Pro providers)
- **Usage dashboard**: Track spending and limits
- **Rate limit handling**: Respect and handle rate limits
- **Plan with X, implement with Y**: Architect with expensive model, implement with cheap

- [ ] Study quota tracking approaches
- [ ] Analyze model selection algorithms
- [ ] Research fallback strategies
- [ ] Design provider management UI
- [ ] Implement routing engine
- [ ] Add quota tracking
- [ ] Build usage dashboard
